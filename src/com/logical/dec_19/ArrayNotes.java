Q. What is the problem with variable and class ?
 Ans : 
 1. Using primitive or class type variables we cannot pass multiple values
    or objects as one value to a method as argument.
 2. We can solve from a method at a time. 
 
Q. How can we solve the above problem ?
 Ans :  We can solve this problem by using method overloading but again this
 problem is not solved.So this can be possible by using referenced data type
 array. 
 
Q. Definition of Array ?
 Ans : An array is a referenced data type used to create fixed number of
       multiple variable of same type as a group to store multiple values of
       homogeneous type in continuous memory location with single variable name.

Q. What is the need of array ?
 Ans :We can use array for storing homogeneous type of multiple values of
     objects and send all those multiple values or objects as single value
     from one method to  another either as an argument or as return value.
     
Q. What is the limitation in array?
 Ans : Its size is fixed, means we cannot increase or decrease its size
       after its creation.


Q. What is the syntax to declare an array?
  <Accessibility modifier> <Execution-level/Non-access Modifiers> <datatype>[]
               <array variable name>;
